Also, under the hood, `shiny` implements layout features available in Bootstrap 2, a popular HTML/CSS framework, but the nice thing about working with `shiny` is that no HTML, CSS, or even Bootstrap experience is necessary to create informative apps!\n",

        "  * The UI is ultimately built with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript; however, you as a shiny developer, do not need to know these languages to build shiny apps, as these languages are wrapped with R and the `shiny` package. If you are an advanced user and do know these languages, there are no limits for customization.\n",

        "\n",
        "Suppose you write a value into a cell in a spreadsheet, and in another cell, you write a formula that depends on that cell. First the formula is calculated with the value you originally typed. Then, when you change the value of the original cell, the result of the formula will automatically update, or react, to this change. In a shiny app, reactivity happens in a similar fashion.\n",

        "In our Shiny app that we built in the last session, we have a `selectInput` with the inputID `z`. No matter what the user inputs, the inputID always stores it as `z`, so whenever the user selects a different option from the list, the value of `z` is updated in the input (`input$`) list.\n",
        "\n",
        "In a shiny application, there's no need to explicitly define relationships between inputs and outputs and tell R what to do when each input changes. Shiny's reactivity automatically handles these details for you.\n",

        "\n",
        "Reactivity makes shiny apps more efficient but also more complex.\n",
        "There are three kinds of objects in reactive programming: **reactive sources, conductors, and endpoints.** \n",
        "\n",
        "1. **Reactive sources** are typically user inputs that come through a browser interface (`input$*`). \n",
        "\n",
        "2. **Reactive endpoints** are objects that appear in a user's browser window, such as a plot or table of values (`output$*`). One reactive source can be connected to multiple endpoints and vice versa. \n",
        "\n",
        "3. **Reactive conductors** (`reactive()`) are reactive components between sources and endpoints. A conductor can be both a child and parent (both being a dependent and having dependents) whereas a source can only be a parent (can only have dependents) and an endpoint can only be a child (can only be a dependent).\n",
        "\n",
        "> We've already made use of these reactive expressions to build our app, updating the backend dataframe, visualized dataframe, map, ggplot, and download every time we select a new date range.\n",
        "\n",
        "**Question for the Audience!**\n",
        "\n",
        "The `nasa_fireball_reactive()` expression in our app is a...\n",
        "\n",
        "* Reactive source\n",
        "\n",
        "* Reactive conductor\n",
        "\n",
        "* Reactive endpoint\n",
        "\n",
        "By using a reactive expression for the subsetted data frame, we were able to get away with subsetting the data only once, but using it 4 times. Reactive conductors, in general, are very nice, because:\n",
        "\n",
        "1. You don't have to repeat yourself and have copy-and-paste code, and\n",
        "\n",
        "2. You can decompose large, complex calculations into smaller pieces to make them more understandable. \n",
        "\n",
        "These advantages of reactive conductors are similar to those gained by decomposing a large, complex R script into a series of smaller functions that build on each other.\n",
        "\n",
        "### Functions vs. Reactives\n",
        "\n",
        "Every time you call a **function,** R will evaluate it.\n",
        "\n",
        "**Reactive expressions** are lazy, and will only execute when their input changes. Even if you call a **reactive expression** multiple times, it only re-executes when its inputs change.\n",
        "\n",
        "### Reactlog\n",
        "Using many reactive expressions in your app can create a complicated dependency structure in your app. \n",
        "The reactlog is a graphical representation of this dependency structure, and it also gives you very detailed information about what's going on under the hood as Shiny goes through and evaluates your application.\n",
        "\n",
        "### Best Practice: View your reactlog.\n",
        "\n",
        "In a fresh R session, type: \n",

        "More information about reactlogs can be found in the [RStudio Documentation](https://shiny.rstudio.com/reference/shiny/1.1.0/showReactLog.html).\n",
        "\n",
        "**Important Advice from RStudio:** \"For security and performance reasons, do not enable `shiny.reactlog` in production environments. When the option is enabled, it's possible for any user of your app to see at least some of the source code of your reactive expressions and observers.\"\n",

        "\n",
        "#### Implementation of reactive sources (e.g. `input$*`): \n",
        "\n",
        "Reactive sources contain many individual reactive values that are set by input from the web browser.\n",
        "\n",
        "#### Implementation of reactive conductors (e.g. `reactive()`):\n",
        "\n",
        "Reactive conductors can access reactive values or other reactive expressions, and they return a value. This is useful for caching the results of any procedure that happens in response to user input.\n",
        "\n",
        "#### Implementation of reactive endpoints (e.g. `observe()`, `output$*`): \n",
        "\n",
        "An `output$*` object is an observer. What's going on under the hood is that a render function returns a reactive expression, and when you assign it to an `output$*` value, Shiny automatically creates an observer that uses the reactive expression. Observers can access reactive sources and reactive expressions, but they don't return a value. They are primarily used for their side effects, including sending data to a web browser.\n",

        "So far, we've just been running (and hosting) our shiny apps locally. To share them with the world, we need to host them on another server. Here's 4 ways for you to do this:\n",
        "\n",
        "1. **Host on shinyapps.io**\n",
        "\n",
        "RStudio provides a service called shinyapps.io which lets you host your apps for free. It is integrated into RStudio so that you can publish your apps with the click of a button, and it has a free version. The free version allows a certain number of apps per user and a certain number of activity on each app, but it should be good enough for just starting out with Shiny. It also lets you see some basic stats about the usage of your app.\n",
        "\n",
        "Hosting your app on shinyapps.io is the easy and recommended way of getting your app online. Go to www.shinyapps.io and sign up for an account. When you're ready to publish your app, click on the \"Publish Application\" button in RStudio and follow their instructions. You might be asked to install a couple packages if it's your first time.\n",
        "\n",
        "After a successful deployment to shinyapps.io, you will be redirected to your app in the browser. You can use that URL to show off to your boss or family and friends what a cool app you wrote.\n",
        "\n",
        "2. **Host on a Shiny server**\n",
        "\n",
        "The other option for hosting your app is on your own private Shiny server, which is also free. Instead of RStudio hosting the app for you, you'll have it on your own private server. This means you'll have a lot more freedom and flexibility, but it also means you'll need to have a server and be comfortable administering a server. I currently host all my apps on my own Shiny server just because I like having the extra control, but when I first learned about Shiny I used shinyapps.io for several months.\n",
        "\n",
        "3. **Host on an AWS EC2 Instance**\n",
        "\n",
        "This hosting environment is fast, efficient, and I recommend it if your company doesn't have an RStudio Connect contract. Work with your IT department and use the tutorial linked below in \"Additional Resources\" to set this up.\n",
        "\n",
        "4. **Host on RStudio Connect**\n",

        "[RStudio Connect](https://www.rstudio.com/products/connect/) is an enterprise publishing platform for the work teams create in R and Python. If your company (like my company, Pacific Life) has a contract here, you can host R Shiny applications, R Markdown reports, Jupyter Notebooks, and more on one convenient, private server.\n",
